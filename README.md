`cl2j.FileStorage` is a multi-providers .NET library written in C# that abstract file operations like read, write, delete and more. It's an open and extensible framework based on interfaces and Dependency Injection.

Providers supported:

- `FileStorageProviderDisk` provider for Local file system
- `FileStorageProviderAzureBlobStorage` provider for Azure Blob Storage

# Getting started

The setup is simple.

Add the nuget package to your project:

```powershell
Install-Package cl2j.FileStorage
```

1. Add the following lines in the appsettings.json:

```json
"cl2j": {
  "FileStorage": {
    "Storages": {
      "Data": {
        "Type": "Disk",
        "Path": "c:\folder>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the previous example, Data is the name of the FileStorage.
Type is the type of the provider, Disk indicate that you want to use a provider that will use the File.IO operations.
Path is the local path, i.e. c:\dev, where the file operations will be done.

2. Configures the services by calling **AddFileStorage()** and then **UseFileStorageDisk()**
3. Get the IFileProvider configured and perform file operations

IFileStorageProvider works with Streams. The library offer utilities, through extensions methods, to simplify text manipulations.

## Web Application

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
  ...

  //Bootstrap the FileStorage to be available from DependencyInjection.
  //This will allow accessing IFileStorageProviderFactory instance
  services.AddFileStorage();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
  ...

  //Add the Disk FileStorage provider
  app.ApplicationServices.UseFileStorageDisk();
}
```

## Console Application

```cs
var services = new ServiceCollection();
...

//Bootstrap the FileStorage to be available from DependencyInjection.
//This will allow accessing IFileStorageProviderFactory instance
services.AddFileStorage();

//Add the Disk FileStorage provider
var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
serviceProvider.UseFileStorageDisk();
```

# Sample code

Here's a class that execute common file operations.

The class receive, by Dependency Injection, the IFileStorageProviderFactory. It request the IFileStorageProvider, represented by the name Data, and execute file operations.

```cs
internal class FileOperationSample
{
    private IFileStorageProvider fileStorageProvider;

    public FileOperationExecutor(IFileStorageProviderFactory fileStorageFactory)
    {
      //Retreive the FileStorage provider
      fileStorageProvider = fileStorageFactory.Get("Data");
    }

    public async Task ExecuteAsync()
    {
      //Create a file with the specified text
      await fileStorageProvider.WriteTextAsync("file1.txt", "First part of the text");

      //Read the file content
      var text = await fileStorageProvider.ReadTextAsync("file1.txt");

      //Append text to the existing file
      await fileStorageProvider.AppendTextAsync("file1.txt", "Second part of the text");

      //Delete the file
      await fileStorageProvider.DeleteAsync("file1.txt");
    }
}
```

# Operations

## Get the File Storage Provider

To perform file operations, you need to get the IFileStorageProviderFactory and request the provider by passing it's name like:

```cs
var fileStorageProviderFactory = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IFileStorageProviderFactory>();
var fileStorageProvider = fileStorageProviderFactory.Get("Data");
```

Here's the operations available from the `IFileStorageProvider` interface:

```cs
public interface IFileStorageProvider
{
  // Write content
  Task WriteAsync(string name, Stream stream);

  // Read content
  Task<bool> ReadAsync(string name, Stream stream);

  // Append content
  Task AppendAsync(string name, Stream stream);

  // Validate if a file exists
  Task<bool> ExistsAsync(string name);

  // List files of directory
  Task<IEnumerable<string>> ListAsync(string path);

  // Get file information
  Task<FileStoreFileInfo> GetInfoAsync(string name);

  // Delete file
  Task DeleteAsync(string name);
}
```

# Azure Blob Storage

To use a Azure Blob Storage in youf project, add the following package:

```powershell
Install-Package cl2j.FileStorage.Provider.AzureBlobStorage
```

In the application configuration, call `UseFileStorageAzureBlobStorage()` like this:

```cs
serviceProvider.UseFileStorageAzureBlobStorage();
```

Add an entry in the appsetttings.json as follow:

```json
"cl2j": {
  "FileStorage": {
    "Storages": {
      "Azure": {
        "Type": "AzureBlobStorage",
        "ConnectionString": "<ConnectionStringToYourStorage>",
        "Container": "<NameOfYourContainer>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Roadmap

We expect to add `Amazon S3` and `Google Cloud Storage` in the coming months.

We will also like to add:

- `FTP` FileStorageProvider
- Copy and move utilities to simplify the operations
